## Installation

To install, copy files from this GitHub repository: https://github.com/AmySuperCoder/Social-network-api.

## Usage

After downloading the files, type npm i and then npm run build. Type npm start to launch the app.

The app does not have a front end design. Users can use Insomnia or any other similar program to perform actions like creating a new user, posting a thought, listing all thoughts, etc. 

## Contributing

I consulted a tutor to help create this app.
